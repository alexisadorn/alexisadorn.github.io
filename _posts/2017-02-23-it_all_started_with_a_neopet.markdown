Coding was never something I thought I'd want to do - so looking back on my journey, I've come to realize that I have Neopets to thank for that initial spark of interest. 

Remember Neopets? Little digital alien pets that you took care of by feeding them, earning money, buying a house and keeping them entertained? (Why did no one warn me that in ten years that would just be called life).

I was obsessed with Neopets when I was a tween. I would hear my mother yelling "Stop buying paintbrushes, it's two in the morning!" Neopets had this awesome feature to make your own website dedicated to your neopets and it was there that I learned the simplest of HTML code `<b> </b>`, `<i> </i>`, and even `<a href="http://www.neopets.com">`. Look out Bill Gates!

Fast forward to high school -  I decided to try out a web design course and made my first official website in Dreamweaver. My teacher even recommended me to another teacher who needed a website for her cheerleading company. My first paid gig! Not too bad for someone who started out on Neopets!

But coding was always a side interest. I graduated college for international studies and thought that I was interested in pursuing a career with nonprofits. I went on to work and volunteer for many nonprofits, and while I did a number of different jobs, I was always seen as the tech-smart person. Many of the nonprofits I worked and volunteered for couldn't afford to hire some fancy web designer, so I offered my services by building simple sites in Wordpress or other platforms.

But after working in the nonprofit industry for four years, I still couldn't see where exactly I was going. I was entering the dreaded "Quarter-Life Crisis" that all mid-to-late-20-or-somethings get to go through.

I sat and thought about my future and what I could picture myself doing for the rest of my life. At one point, my mother said to me, "Why not look into computer programming? You've always been good with computers, and the money's pretty good!"

I hadn't ever considered it. It seemed a little too smart for me - I'm not really a math and science kind of gal. But I looked into it anyways, and discovered that there were so many resources available online and in bootcamps and schools for me to change career paths. 

I saw an article about a new coding bootcamp in Silicon Valley that was completely tuition-free and teacher-free. I thought, 'this is obviously a scam', but after doing some research and filling out the application, I was pulling up to the [42 USA](https://www.42.us.org/) campus in Fremont, CA. A one-month intensive bootcamp learning C was the perfect opportunity for me to find out if coding was really what I wanted to do. It was an incredibly stressful, brutal, difficult month, but I learned a lot about my work ethic, my passions, and my breaking points.  I came out of that bootcamp exhausted, crying and more determined than ever. 

I am so excited to be starting the Web Development program with Flatiron and can't wait to put my new skills to use!
